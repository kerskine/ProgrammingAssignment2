Here's my submission to Programming Assignment #2.

*Special thanks* to Len Greski for writing ["Demystifying makeVector()"(https://github.com/lgreski/datasciencectacontent/blob/master/markdown/rprog-breakingDownMakeVector.md).

If you haven't read this at least three times, you'll never understand how the code you produce actually works.
